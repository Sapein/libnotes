## QnA  
### Why does libnotes have it's own docs directory and it's own Doxyfile?  
Because, libnotes is effectively a separate library, which others can just rip out and include
in their own projects, as such it has its own documentation in order to facilitate that.

### Why not split out libnotes into its own repository?  
Because this is currently the only project that uses it, in addition to just making it easier for me
to include it in-source.

### Is libnotes licensed the same way?  
Yes, it's exactly the same, the only difference is that has its own documentation.
