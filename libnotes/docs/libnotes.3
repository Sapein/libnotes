.Sh DESCRIPTION
libnotes proves a simple API to work with simple notes across any system, for implementing sticky-note like functionality.
Each note is a file that may be opened or closed as necessary with the related functions.

Notes may use Markdown, with the only requirement for use of markdown being that the header of a note be a valid markdown
header before anything other text. Otherwise the formatting of the note is open.
